### Hanger is a graphical tool for process orchestration and data quality, responsible for the execution of [ETL](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) processes, dependency control and data validation.

## Instalation

##### REQUIREMENTS

- Tomcat 8 +
- MySQL 5.7 +
- Java 8 +
- Jenkins ( [https://jenkins.io/](https://jenkins.io/) )
- Jenkins Notification Plugin ( [https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Notification+Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Notification+Plugin) )

##### CONSTRUCTION
Using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/):

- Go to the directory where the Hanger sources are located.
- Type the **mvn package** command.
- The hanger.war file will be generated on the *target* subdirectory.

##### CONFIGURATION

- Create a database on Mysql/MariaDB and an user with full permition only for the database that will receive Hanger's metadata.

```
# Example to run using Mysql/MariaDB root/admin user

# Create a database named hanger
CREATE DATABASE hanger default character set utf8 default collate utf8_bin;

# Create an user named hanger
CREATE USER hanger@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'SetYourPassword';

# Releases hanger user access to the database which has the same name
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on hanger.* to 'hanger'@'localhost' identified by 'SetYourPassword';

# Update permitions
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```


- Create the ~/.hanger/hanger.properties file with the follow content:

```
# Hanger MySQL
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://<host>:<port>/<db>?serverTimezone=GMT-3
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

	> You can use ***Markdown*** to type the description text.
- On ***Time Restriction*** field, inform the allowed period in [cron](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html) format to execute the *job*.
- Define the content of the ***Lookback window*** field of the *job* between 0 and 12 hours. For a *job* dependency to be considered attended it must have been successfully carried out at least once a day. If some dependency wants to be executed before midnight, the ***Lookback window*** field must be filled with the number of hours, before midnight, so that, if the *job* runs successfully, the dependency is considered fulfilled.

When this option is checked, the *job* will be executed for the first time when all the dependencies are catered and will be executed again always when, during the day all the dependencies are successfully catered. If it is necesssary to execute the *job* again only when all the dependencies are successfully catered again, select which dependencies will be blockers on parents list. For default, a *job* can be executed only once a day.
- Check the option ***Build on any parent scope*** to allow that the *job* can be pushed, regardless of the parents execution scope.
- Click on ***Parent*** button if you want to add a dependency to the current *job*.

- At the end, click on ***Save*** button to save.

##### PARENT
A dependency is nothing more than a *job* defined as the *parent* of another specific *job*. In other words, this means that in order for the *job* to be executed, it is necessary for its *parents* to be executed first.

- On the ***Add job*** page, click on ***Parent*** button.
- A modal will be displayed.
- Select the *jobs* that you want to define as *parents* for the current *job*.
- Check the ***Import upstream project*** option, if the *jobs* on Jenkins have upstream *jobs*, so that the list of dependencies represented by Jenkins upstream *jobs* is replicated to Hanger's dependency engine.
- Click on ***Add*** button to add the selected parents.
- Click on ***Close*** if you want to cancel the operation.

Once the *job* has some *parent*, you may need to change some dependencies's settings.

- On side menu, access the ***Job*** option.
- Select the *job* that you want to configure.
- Click on ***Edit*** button.
- If the *job* needs to be executed more than once a day, but only after all the dependencies are completed again, it is necessary to select which dependencies will be ***Blockers***. For that, you just need to check the ***Blocker*** option.
- Click on ***Build history*** button, represented by the "***+***" symbol, to view the *job's* build history.
- You also may need to change some dependency's scope. You can do that by selecting the scope that you want on ***Scope*** field.
	- We can say that scopes are like *job* execution categories, that is, the scope determines the type of execution of the *job* or dependency. There is three Scopes options in the Hanger:

		- ***FULL***: Identifies that all dependencies with FULL or PARTIAL scope must be met before the *job* can be executed.
		- ***PARTIAL***: Identifies that all dependencies with PARTIAL scope must be met before the *job* can be executed. The *job* will run with the partial scope, as not all of its dependencies have been met.
		- ***OPTIONAL***: Identifies that the dependencies is optional, that is, whether it is answered or not, the *job* will run normally. If all dependencies for a *job* have the OPTIONAL scope, it will be executed as soon as the first dependency is met.
	- In short, in this field just inform which of the scopes above the *job* has.

- If you want to remove some parent from the mainly *job*, just click on ***Remove*** button.

Finally, just run the *job* and view the *Flow* to confirm that everything went as expected.

Note: on ***Flow*** is possible to see all the *job's* dependencies in chain, as well as it execution process.

##### SHELL SCRIPT
This option allows to apply a template on the *job*.
On the ***Add job*** page, click on ***Shell Script button*** button, if you want to apply shell script commands on the *job*.

- A text area named ***Shell Script*** will be created.
- Inform the shell script commands that you want.
- Click on ***Remove*** button to delete the shell script, if it is necessary.

***Note***: rather than create the shell script commands, you can apply a ***Shell Script template*** by clicking on the ***up arrow*** button, then select the template that you want to use.

##### SUBJECT
On the ***Add job*** page, click on ***Subject*** button, if you want to classify the *job* in one or more subjects. The ***Subject*** modal will be displayed that allows to select one or more subjects for the *job*.

- After select the chosen subjects, click on ***Add*** button to add it.
- A section called ***Subjects*** will be created, where it is possible to manage the *job* subjects.
- Click on ***Remove*** button to delete a subject, if it is necessary.

##### CHECKUP
If it is necessary execute the validation of the data from *job* execution, on the ***Add job*** page click on ***Checkup*** button. Will be created a new section called *Checkup* that allows to define a SQL instruction for validation. Follow the steps below to create a checkup:

- On field ***Name***, inform the *checkup* name.
- On ***Description*** field, inform checkup description.
- On ***Connection*** field, select in which connection the validation will be executed.
- Define in which scope the validation will be executed. For that, select one of the ***Scope*** options:
	- ***FULL***: the *job* checkup will be executed only when all the dependencies with FULL and PARTIAL scope are concluded.
	- ***PARTIAL***: the *job* checkup will be executed only when all the dependencies with PARTIAL scope are concluded.
	- ***ANYONE***: the *job* checkup will be executed always when the dependencies with FULL or PARTIAL scope are concluded.
- Define the SQL validation instruction on ***SQL Select Statement*** field, it is possible to reference the result of another ckeckup, using the following sintax: ${{checkup ID}}.The resultset must return only an integer value.
- Select the condition on ***Condition***.
- Define the expected result on Threshold field. It is possible to reference the result of another ckeckup, using the following sintax: ***${checkup ID}***.
- On ***On fail*** field, select the action that will be executed, whether the validation fails. The available options are:
	- ***NOTHING***: just block the chain execution.
	- ***REBUILD***: if it is a pos validation, the *job* is executed again. Otherwise, it has the same effect of NOTHING.
	- ***REBUILD_MESH***:  if it is a pos validation, all the *job* dependencies and the dependencies of each dependency are executed again. Otherwise, it has the same effect of NOTHING.
